# Loan-approval-prediction
Brief description:
A machine learning model to predict loan approval based on applicant details like credit score, income, employment status, and loan amount.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
Use classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Evaluate model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

 Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
Flask/FastAPI (optional for API deployment)

 3. Additional Enhancements for GitHub
ðŸ”¹ Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb): Showcase your workflow in an interactive way.
ðŸ”¹ GitHub Actions: Automate testing or model training on push events.
ðŸ”¹ Streamlit App: Create a simple UI for users to input loan details and get predictions.
ðŸ”¹ GitHub Pages: Host a small website with project details.
